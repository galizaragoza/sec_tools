# Template for intelligence gathering about a target.
# Take any template with the same format as this one and run the following commands (with 
# capital T, in the examples it is lowercase so it is not written to the files)
# sed -n -r -e 's/(TARGET)/<TARGET>/p' target_SEOSINT_list
# sed -n -r -e 's/(TARGET)/<TARGET>/p' test | awk '{print "- [ ] "  $0}'
# Command 1 will generate a simple list with newlines between each query
# Command 2 will generate a list that will render as a to-do list on Obsidian (idk if it works on no
# rmal markup or other text editors)
